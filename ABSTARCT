Effective management of sleep patterns is crucial for improving overall wellness, with
individualized recommendations playing a significant role in achieving optimal health. The
RhythmRestore project leverages machine learning techniques to provide personalized
lifestyle recommendations based on user input, focusing on improving sleep quality, mood,
stress levels, and other factors impacting well-being. By analysing data related to sleep time,
screen time, meals skipped, mood, and work-related stress, the system offers tailored
suggestions on diet, exercise, and stress management.
The system uses a combination of supervised learning algorithms, such as decision trees and
ensemble methods, to predict users' ideal sleep routines and suggest strategies for improving
health outcomes. Evaluations are based on accuracy metrics like mean squared error (MSE)
and user feedback on recommendation effectiveness. The model consistently demonstrated
its ability to provide personalized, actionable advice, empowering users to make informed
decisions about their lifestyle.
By offering targeted guidance for wellness optimization, RhythmRestore aims to enhance
users' overall health by addressing common sleep and lifestyle challenges. This approach
can help users develop healthier routines, improve their productivity, and reduce the
negative impacts of poor sleep and stress on daily life.
